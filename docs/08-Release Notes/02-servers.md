# Server

## 0.10.0

Released: 01/11/2025

OpenUEM console has received three major features: 

- [Authentication with OpenID Connect](/docs/04-Console/01-intro.md#openid-connect) is now available. You can use Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak or Zitadel as identity providers to authenticate users. Thanks to stavrosk, mpweya  and cr1sti for the suggestions to bring it to OpenUEM. 
- [RustDesk integration](/docs/04-Console/07-computers.md#2123-rustdesk). OpenUEM can use RustDesk to offer remote assistance. OpenUEM instructs the agents to configure RustDesk according to the admin needs. 
- [Remote Assistance](/docs/04-Console/07-computers.md#2121-vnc) now includes some checks to inform the administrator about the possible options to offer remote assistance and check if requirements are met. 

:::danger
For those using OpenUEM with Docker (docker compose), please note that the `build/nats/generate-nats-conf.sh` file must be changed to include the new permissions for the rustdesk configuration messages.

The new file can be downloaded from: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-uem/openuem-docker/refs/heads/main/build/nats/generate-nats-conf.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-uem/openuem-docker/refs/heads/main/build/nats/generate-nats-conf.sh)

Once the file is replaced a new NATS container must be rebuilt using:

```
docker compose --profile openuem up --force-recreate -d --build nats-server
```
