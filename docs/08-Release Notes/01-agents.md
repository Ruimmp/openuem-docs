## 0.9.0

Released: 01/11/2025

The agent for Windows has experienced major changes to improve its performance, dropping the usage of Windows DSC files. The agent now controls better if a task has already run, or if a profile hasn’t finished applying all the tasks. Thanks to cr1sti for reporting the issue. 

A nasty bug that affected the Windows agent (getting empty values) has been fixed. Thanks to tarello30 and raito88 in the Discord channel for the help to discover and test the fix. Also, a path has been added to fix macOS agents that could not reconnect to NATS after a timeout. Thanks to wolrah and parkthecar in the Discord channel for the valuable feedback to identify the issue.

## 0.6.0

Released: 15/05/2025

:::warning
BREAKING CHANGE in Debian

Existing Debian/Ubuntu agents must be reinstalled manually either using the .deb package or using OpenUEM's apt repo. The reason is that a new dialog will ask for the Organization ID and Site ID that you want OpenUEM to be associated with (should be Org ID 1 and Site ID 1 for the default org and site created automatically by OpenUEM)

:::

:::danger
Due to a bug found in the agent updater, you won't be able to update 0.5.0 agents from the console (0.4.0 agents and lower are not affected) and you'll have to update the agents by hand or using a script to deploy it. The 0.6.0 windows installer can be run to upgrade the 0.5.0 agent. You can also use the debian repository to use apt on the affected endpoints to update the debian/ubuntu agent.
:::

- Feat: get processor info if more than one windows processor is found
- Feat: agents can set a default printer and remove a printer for Linux and Windows
- Feat: add tenant and site to INI and report
